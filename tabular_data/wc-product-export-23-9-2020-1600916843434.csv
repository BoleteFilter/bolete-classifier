Initially it went into Boletellus. Then it got moved to the newly erected genus Heimioporus. Then it got moved back. Then... For those who care, as of November, 2015 the consensus is as follows: (1) There is molecular evidence to support a generic affiliation with either Heimioporus or Boletellus, (2) There is NOT enough molecular evidence to choose between Heimioporus &amp; Boletellus, and therefore (3) we are going to stick with Boletellus betula until more evidence comes along to settle the issue.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>No data.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Austroboletus-betula.html "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mushroom Expert</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Austroboletus betula"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mushroom Observer</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroboletus-betula"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wikipedia</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Austroboletus betula"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google Image Search</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0394519922"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-619"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lincoff-Audubon.jpg"" alt=""National Audubon Society Field guide to Mushrooms, Gary Lincoff"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">563</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0813122627"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-621"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roody-WV-mushrooms.jpg"" alt=""Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">298</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0815632444"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-620"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/North-American-Boletes.jpg"" alt=""North American Boletes"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">79</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2560"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boletes-of-Eastern-North-America-1-e1496427834704.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""95"" height=""143"" /></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">219</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",,,none,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"FILTER SET #1: REGION > ZONE 5 - the SOUTH > 1.

Shallow, bright yellow pores may bruise blue. Red-and-yellow stem. Red bug holes in yellow stem flesh.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> Cap flesh is usually lighter than stem flesh (buff-yellow above true yellow). Flesh blues vaguely, if at all. Deeper tubes prove you have a different species but shallow tubes do not prove it's this one because that's also true for other mushrooms. Stem may have a little netting, but that is rare.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> This is almost certain to be a complex of similar looking mushrooms that will not come into focus without an extensive DNA study. Fortunately, it seems that the non- and slow-bluing ones are pretty much all good edibles, with some being truly prime. DNA testing has moved this mushroom into the newly erected genus ""Baorangia"" (from the Chinese words for ""thin pore layer"") and created a host of interesting questions. It turns out that bicolor has one of the weirdest distributions you can imagine: common in the American Northeast, and common in Nepal/China. Amazing! At the same time a number of the lookalikes have been moved to a second, newly-erected genus (Lanmaoa), while still more remain in Boletus because no one has studied them well enough yet to place them somewhere else. Stay tuned for what are bound to be an extended series of future developments. NOTE: This species has been removed from both the Texas and Florida regional filters because modern experts have relocated all those finds into local species - most often <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/product/boletus-rubricitrinus/"">Pulchroboletus rubricitrinus</a>.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good, with caution. Some specimens have been known to cause GI distress in people who usually eat and enjoy bicolors. Experts tend to presume these were crypto-, lookalike species hidden within this group/complex.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>No reaction.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>Cap surface has no reaction.

(<u>Boletes of Eastern North America</u> follows this by merging the American <em>""discolor""</em> into <em>""luridiformis,""</em> using Neoboletus as the genus). It is a mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears.\n\nHere's the problem: are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European <em>queletii</em> and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern - massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA - but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing... but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason <em>discolor</em>, <em>luridiformis</em> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridellus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>subluridellus</em></a> still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged. If you must pick one, use <em>subluridellus</em> - at least it is an American name that won't have to change. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subvelutipes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subvelutipes</em></a> really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.\n\nAnd about that genus... We have kept <em>""discolor""</em> in Boletus for now because that is the accepted ""grab bag"" and there is not enough evidence to move it into another genus. One hopes the science will catch up to both of these, along with the other hard-to-distinguish red pored, blue staining lookalikes such as , <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subluridus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-flammans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. flammans</em></a>, not to mention the one now known as <em><a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-luridus/"">Suillellus luridus</a></em>, the several moved to Rubroboletus, and the brown-pored blue-stainers <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosoides/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosoides</em></a>.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> The traditional instruction in America was clear: <em>""Avoid the red-pored blue-stainers like this one because they are known sick makers.""</em> That came under question beginning in the 2010's as DNA evidence proved that these mushrooms are quite distinct from the Rubroboletus and Suillellus genera that contain the true ""Satans Boletes"". For what it's worth, the lookalike European mushroom called luridimormis/discolor is a highly prized edible commonly known as the Scarletina. So it comes down to your taste for adventure and your respect for received wisdom.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap surface yellow changes to dark slate and darker areas change to rusty brown.

The farther away a mushroom is on the genetic family tree, the more likely it will be moved out of Boletus and into some other genera. On the East Coast, the ""longer stem and yellower"" version discussed in North American Boletes (<em>clavipes</em>) has been merged with regular edulis as a result of DNA tests, while <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/xanthoconium-separans/""><em>separans</em></a> has been moved out of Xanthoconium and back into Boletus because it’s genetically close. By contrast, many West Coast relatives have been severed off into separate but no less delicious species. These include <em><a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-edulis-var-grandedulis-barstools/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">B. edulis var. grandedulis</a></em> (“California Kings”), <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-rubriceps-rocky-mountain-red/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. rubriceps</em></a> (“Rocky Mountain Reds”) and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-barrowsii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. barrowsii</em></a> (“White Kings”).

If you think you're looking at a possible <em>huronensis</em>, you should definitely check out <a href=""http://www.namyco.org/boletus_huronensis.php"">this article by mycologist Bill Bataikis</a> in addition to your books. It contains descriptions of the mushroom from various sources, along with a number of useful photos. One particular point that may be useful is this account credited to Grund and Harrison, <u>Nova Scotian Boletes</u> (1976) at pp. 112-114:\n<p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0in .5in 12.0pt .5in;"">""We have tested the edibility of this species, and report that it has an excellent flavor and no unpleasant after-effects [contrary to the experience of certain others!]. <em>It is usually free of maggots while B. edulis found at the same time is often riddled with them</em>, which adds to its desirability as an esculent [in other words ""as an edible"" - use of an obscure word proves they're genuine scientists and not pretenders].”</p>\nThis <a href=""http://www.namyco.org/docs/6_Andrus.pdf"">first hand account</a> of a poisoning blamed on <em>huronensis</em> also described the mushroom as ""worm free."" So if you're in an area where the <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-edulis/""><em>B. edulis</em></a> are typically infested with bug holes, the lack of larval tunnels may be a clue that you've now got a <em>huronensis</em> instead. Double check to see if the flesh has a yellower-than-usual shade, look for any hint of bluing in that flesh, and double-check the pores for any bluing too. And just in case you think this might be excessive, <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-rubriceps-rocky-mountain-red/"">Click here for a first hand account</a> of a poisoning that's blamed on this particular mushroom. Not at all fun.\n\n<strong>2018 DNA Update:</strong> A very well confirmed find (<span style=""color: #3366ff;""><a style=""color: #3366ff;"" href=""https://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_observation/331948"">Mushroom Observer #331948</a></span>) was submitted for multigene DNA testing in late 2018, and the results answer a lot of questions. They show that <em>huronensis</em> is not even close to being a true Boletus, but actually does have a single close relative: the toxic Japanese bolete <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;""><i>Neoboletus venenatus</i></span></span>.<span style=""color: #000000;""> Someone needs to write a paper...</span></span>\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Avoid.

B. luridiformis has a darker cap and darker yellow flesh than <em><a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-discolor/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">B. discolor</a></em>, but chemical tests are required to conclusively distinguish the two (they have distinctly different reactions to Ammonia and KOH).\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> The European species formerly known as <em>Boletus discolor</em>, and <em>Boletus luridiformis</em>, <em>Boletus erythropus</em>, and <em>Boletus queletii</em> have been merged into a single species that is now called <em>Sutorius (f/k/a Neoboletus) queletii</em>. (<u>Boletes of Eastern North America</u> follows this by merging the American <em>""discolor""</em> into <em>""luridiformis,""</em> using Neoboletus as the genus). It is a mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears.\n\nHere's the problem: are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European <em>queletii</em> and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern - massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA - but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing... but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason <em>discolor</em>, <em>luridiformis</em> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridellus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>subluridellus</em></a> still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged. If you must pick one, use <em>subluridellus</em> - at least it is an American name that won't have to change. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subvelutipes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subvelutipes</em></a> really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.\n\nAnd about that genus... We have kept <em>""discolor""</em> and ""subluridellus"" in Boletus for now because that is the accepted ""grab bag"" and there is not enough evidence to move it into another genus. This one got moved to match it's European lookalike. One hopes the science will catch up to both of these, along with the other hard-to-distinguish red pored, blue staining lookalikes such as , <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subluridus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-flammans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. flammans</em></a>, not to mention the one now known as <em><a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-luridus/"">Suillellus luridus</a></em>, the several moved to Rubroboletus, and the brown-pored blue-stainers <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosoides/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosoides</em></a>.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> The traditional instruction in America was clear: <em>""Avoid the red-pored blue-stainers like this one because they are known sick makers.""</em> That came under question beginning in the 2010's as DNA evidence proved that these mushrooms are quite distinct from the Rubroboletus and Suillellus genera that contain the true ""Satans Boletes"". For what it's worth, the lookalike European mushroom called luridimormis/discolor is a highly prized edible commonly known as the Scarletina. So it comes down to your taste for adventure and your respect for received wisdom.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap surface turns dark amber.

Yellow pores bruise blue &amp; age toward orange/brown. White to yellow cap flesh may blue slowly &amp; faintly. May grow in united clusters or as individuals. Your author has personally found specimens with a cap &gt;11"" across.\n\n<strong>More Notes:</strong> Not uncommon in the Pittsburgh area, where in the 2015 Spring we observed a slow (5-10 minutes), progressive (from the base up), blue-green stain in the stem flesh, which faded 10-20 minutes later. Later in the year the green was more erratic. Reports from other regions confirm similar progressive staining, often near the stem skin more than the base. We also find a mushroom believed to be pallidoroseus but with a true ""red"" coloration rather than the more typical pink. DNA analysis to confirm the ID of the true-red specimens are in progress.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Edible, with little flavor but a fantastic texture.

(The California version typically has a red-, chestnut-, or liver-brown cap).

This surviving, combined species was then renamed from “spadiceus” to ferrugineus for reasons that probably make sense to the very smart people who did it, but causes nothing except confusion in the rest of us. [Sigh]. The three had been divided up because of morphological (physically apparent) differences. Now that the DNA confirms they are one and the same, we’re left with a single species that has tremendous variability.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap skin flashes green (sometimes greenish-blue) before turning reddish brown (sometimes grayer).</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>Cap flesh turns olive-green.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Xerocomus-ferrugineus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Expert</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Xerocomus ferrugineus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Observer</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerocomus-ferrugineus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Xerocomus ferrugineus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Image Search</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0394519922"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-619"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lincoff-Audubon.jpg"" alt=""National Audubon Society Field guide to Mushrooms, Gary Lincoff"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0813122627"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-621"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roody-WV-mushrooms.jpg"" alt=""Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0815632444"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-620"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/North-American-Boletes.jpg"" alt=""North American Boletes"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">158 (spadiceus)\n159 (var. gracilis)\n&amp; rufobrunneus)</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2560"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boletes-of-Eastern-North-America-1-e1496427834704.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""95"" height=""143"" /></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">105</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",,,none,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"FILTER SET #1: REGION > ZONE 1- the NORTHEAST > 1.

See the Science Notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Common Name:</strong> Red Mouth Bolete\n\n<strong>Tells:</strong> Reddish cap bruises blue/black &amp; is often olive when young. Pores start yellow, become rosy red, age to orange, &amp; bruise blue. Pale yellow stem, often w/reddish dots, browns from base up w/age.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> Bright yellow flesh blues too, also very fast. Likes oak. Stem may be dotted but is not netted and does not have hairs, which distinguishes from lookalikes. Odor described as ""peculiar and somewhat pungent but distinctive."" That is the old line used to distinguish it from <em>discolor</em> and <em>luridiformis</em>.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> The European species formerly known as <em>Boletus discolor</em>, and <em>Boletus luridiformis</em>, <em>Boletus erythropus</em>, and <em>Boletus queletii</em> have been merged into a single species that is now called <em>Sutorius (f/k/a Neoboletus) queletii</em>. (<u>Boletes of Eastern North America</u> follows this by merging the American <em>""discolor""</em> into <em>""luridiformis,""</em> using Neoboletus as the genus). It is a mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears.\n\nHere's the problem: are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European <em>queletii</em> and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern - massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA - but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing... but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason <em>discolor</em>, <em>luridiformis</em> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridellus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>subluridellus</em></a> still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged. If you must pick one, use <em>subluridellus</em> - at least it is an American name that won't have to change. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subvelutipes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subvelutipes</em></a> really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.\n\nAnd about that genus... We have kept <em>""discolor""</em> in Boletus for now because that is the accepted ""grab bag"" and there is not enough evidence to move it int0 another genus. One hopes the science will catch up to both of these, along with the other hard-to-distinguish red pored, blue staining lookalikes such as , <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-subluridus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. subluridus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-flammans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>B. flammans</em></a>, not to mention the one now known as <em><a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-luridus/"">Suillellus luridus</a></em>, the several moved to Rubroboletus, and the brown-pored blue-stainers <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosus</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-vermiculosoides/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>vermiculosoides</em></a>.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> The traditional instruction in America was clear: <em>""Avoid the red-pored blue-stainers like this one because they are known sick makers.""</em> That came under question beginning in the 2010's as DNA evidence proved that these mushrooms are quite distinct from the Rubroboletus and Suillellus genera that contain the true ""Satans Boletes"". For what it's worth, the lookalike European mushroom called luridimormis/discolor is a highly prized edible commonly known as the Scarletina. So it comes down to your taste for adventure and your respect for received wisdom.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>Blue-stained cap flesh turns yellow and then orange.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Boletus-subluridellus-.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Expert</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Boletus subluridellus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Observer</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus-subluridellus-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Boletus subluridellus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Image Search</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0394519922"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-619 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lincoff-Audubon.jpg"" alt=""National Audubon Society Field guide to Mushrooms, Gary Lincoff"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0813122627"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-full wp-image-621 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roody-WV-mushrooms.jpg"" alt=""Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"">291</td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0815632444"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-full wp-image-620 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/North-American-Boletes.jpg"" alt=""North American Boletes"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"">164</td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2560 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boletes-of-Eastern-North-America-1-e1496427834704.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""95"" height=""143"" /></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"">163</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",,,none,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"FILTER SET #1: REGION > ZONE 1- the NORTHEAST > 1.

Expect ""austrinus"" to be revived as one of the species names for this group once a broad DNA study has been completed to tell us how many species there are. We are folding the names together until then.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Common Name:</strong> ""Red Mouth Bolete""\n\n<strong>Tells:</strong> Red/brown/orange pores instantly stain blue, as does the bright yellow flesh. Blue-staining red/yellow stem has no netting, and should have velvety hairs at the base.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> Found under hemlock and occasionally another conifer; the lookalike oak-lover is genetically distinct. Flesh has sometimes been reported as tasting a bit acidic, but that is not a reliable characteristic and may actually indicate one of the as-yet-unnamed subspecies (see Science Notes). The hairs at the stem base (which look more like velvet than hairs) are also unreliable. Specimens showing the velvety hairs typically have a yellow fuzz when young, which quickly turns dark red.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> The traditional instruction in America was clear: <em>""Avoid the red-pored blue-stainers like this one because they are known sick makers.""</em> That came under question beginning in the 2010's as DNA evidence proved that these mushrooms are quite distinct from the Rubroboletus and Suillellus genera that contain the true ""Satans Boletes"". The close relatives of these species (see the Science Notes) are not only edible, but good. Indeed the all-but-lookalike European mushroom now known as <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-luridiformis/"">Sutorius luridiformis (<em>f/k/a</em> Boletus discolor)</a> has been greedily sought forever as the choice ""Scarletina."" Your mileage may vary. For site purposes it is being promoted to ""iffy"" as a reflection of the ongoing debate, but with the proviso that all the old lore would disagree.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> The species was originally described in 1889 by the legendary mycologist Charles Horton Peck. The velvety hairs at the base - which many modern foragers have despaired of finding - was actually the basis for Peck's decision to declare it a species. <span class=""oi732d6d ik7dh3pa d2edcug0 qv66sw1b c1et5uql a8c37x1j irj2b8pg enqfppq2 jq4qci2q a3bd9o3v knj5qynh oo9gr5id"" dir=""auto"">Sub- = barely; velut- =velvety; and -pes = foot. </span>After 1889 the description slowly morphed until it really came to mean, <em>“That common red-pored, blue-staining, non-reticulated mushroom in the East.”</em> In other words, genuine experts used such a broad brush that everyone knew the DNA revolution would show it to be a group of similar looking mushrooms that would need to be sorted out. And sure enough, the DNA testing has confirmed just. This site chooses to limit the name ""subvelutipes"" to the hemlock-lover because (a) that is a distinct genetic species, (b) your author participated in an effort to find an ""epitype"" to replace Peck's original ""holotype"" because that sample no longer has usable DNA, (c) the general location where we found it was dominated by hemlock, and (d) the specific finds were under a grove of hemlock. The velvety foot is very important for a firm ID, subject to environmental factors that will often hide or destroy such a delicate feature.\n\nThe parallel, oak-loving red mouths appear in the books under a series European names such as <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-discolor/""><em>discolor</em></a> and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/boletus-luridiformis/""><em>luridiformis</em></a>, along with poorly described American names like <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/product/boletus-subluridellus/"">subluridellus</a>. Unpublished DNA work suggests 4-5 separate species in that category that will ultimately require ""holding names"" until the scientific method plays out\n\nFinally, there is an undescribed species found in the Southwest mountains that is either <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">subvelutipes</span> or a good lookalike. We are waiting for DNA results before expanding the published geographic range to include those finds.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap skin turns mahogany-red.

Salt &amp; pepper stem may have green-blue stains by base. White-buff pores age brownish &amp; often bruise olive- to dark brown.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> DNA tests merged two species to create this one: <em>L. atrostipitatum</em> and <em>L. testaceoscabrum</em>. The combination was then renamed ""versipelle"" by the learned, a European name that was presumably chosen to cause confusion among those who are not. Note that <em>atrostipitatum</em> and <em>testaceoscabrum</em> had different reported reactions to iron salts, turning bluish gray and bright green respectively. See <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/the-red-and-orange-capped-leccinums/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this Article on the Red-Cap Leccinum Taxonomy Mess</a> for more information, and don't be surprised if the merger turns out to be applicable only to European species with something else entirely being proper for North America.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Variable. <em>Atrostipitatum</em> was considered a good edible, but some reported GI distress from <em>testaceoscabrum</em>. Now that the two are merged you'll have to judge for yourself.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap flesh turns bluish.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>Cap flesh turns bluish-gray.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Leccinum-atrostipitatum-.html "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mushroom Expert</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Leccinum atrostipitatum "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mushroom Observer</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leccinum-atrostipitatum-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wikipedia</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Leccinum atrostipitatum "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google Image Search</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0394519922"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-619"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lincoff-Audubon.jpg"" alt=""National Audubon Society Field guide to Mushrooms, Gary Lincoff"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">577</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0813122627"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-621"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roody-WV-mushrooms.jpg"" alt=""Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0815632444"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-620"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/North-American-Boletes.jpg"" alt=""North American Boletes"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">197</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2560"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boletes-of-Eastern-North-America-1-e1496427834704.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""95"" height=""143"" /></td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;"">271</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",,,none,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"FILTER SET #1: REGION > ZONE 1- the NORTHEAST > 1.

This is an example. Once upon a time there was a N.A. mushroom named ""carpini"" after its similarity to the European species of that name - this entry. DNA has proved they are not the same; but what is this one? In North American Boletes the range for ""carpini"" was set at Canada south to Florida, west to Michigan. In Boletes of Eastern North America the range is limited to the South, with <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/leccinellum-griseum/"">Leccinellum griseum</a> being limited to the south (and liking oak), <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/leccinellum-quercophilum/"">Leccinellum quercophilum</a> (new) being limited to the north, and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/leccinellum-crocipodium/"">Leccinellum crocipodium</a>, and <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/leccinum-rugosiceps/"">Leccinum rugosiceps</a> being the wrinkled-cap scaber-stalks with broad ranges.

A northern species that may be found in the Appalachians at higher altitudes.\n\n<strong>Science Notes: </strong>This species used to be split in two based on whether the flesh stained red (<em>var. americanum</em>). DNA testing has confirmed that the staining feature is not enough to support different species.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap skin turns pinkish.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>Cap skin has a very quick pink flash that disappears within a second or two.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>Cap skin slowly turns grayish olive.

Whitish pores age to gray-brown &amp; may slowly bruise to yellow- or olive-brown. Favors birch but also found with oak and other hardwoods.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> CAP: Varies annoyingly from concave in youth to broadly convex in age, &amp; any color from white or buff-pink through yellow-brown to brown-black. PORES: Can be quite deep. STEM: Scabers often start pale &amp; darken w/age &amp; toward base. Stem may also have distinct blue-green stains by base or yellowish tones higher up. FLESH: White cap flesh often DNS; may stain pink, brown, burgundy- or purplish-gray; and if it stains, may or may not resolve to violet-gray or black. Grrr. Oh yes: the stem flesh has been known to stain blue by the base. Double grrr. ENVIRONMENT: Likes birch, but not exclusively. OTHER: There are many lookalikes and the whole Leccinum genus is sort of up-in-the-air until DNA testing identifies some more useful patterns. If you’re in California, <a href=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/product/leccinum-montanum/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>L. montanum</em></a> is a particularly common lookalike that grows under aspen.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> DNA tests have merged no less than three (3!) species into scabrum.

Viscid cap. Whitish pores age yellow &amp; usually stain dull cinnamon.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> Likes white pine, though rumor says it may grow with other conifers too. Cap color can vary from tan, through yellow to cinnamon &amp; red-brown, and is often streaked or checked when fresh. Stem often darkens by the base. Young specimens exude milky droplets from the pores. A good edible, though many people prefer to remove the cap skin. May taste acidic.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">North American Boletes</span> lists <em>Suillus lactifluus</em> as a separate species. DNA tests have merged the two. As to the name, that wonderful name ""granulatus"" is now reserved for the original European species, leaving we poor Americans with the waste of letters ""weaverae"". What can you do?\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good, though many people prefer to remove the cap skin.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap skin turns bluish gray, but stem skin turns purplish brown. Cap flesh turns pinkish or reddish orange before shifting to bluish or purplish with an orange border. Pores turn rusty orange.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>Cap skin turns dark olive or olive-gray, but stem skin turns purplish brown. Cap flesh turns pinkish brown (<em>lactifluus</em> reportedly turned dull lilac blue). Pores turn an instant rusty orange that quickly shifts to purplish brown.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>Cap skin turns bluish or olive gray, but stem skin turns dark green.

Dark red- to black-brown pores stain green-blue but resolve to brown. Odd smell.\n\n<strong>Other Information:</strong> Dark brown, often-cracked cap. White cap flesh smells pungent (clove-like or resembling coal tar) &amp; stains blue (sometimes slowly), before resolving to red-brown &amp; then gray-brown or gray black. May grow on well-decayed logs &amp; stumps. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A special tell</span>: Wrap the mushroom in wax paper for an hour and the paper will stain blue.\n\n<strong>Science Notes:</strong> DNA testing moved this mushroom into the newly erected genus ""Porphyrellus."" There is an ongoing name debate between <em>porphyrosporus</em> and <em>pseudoscaber</em>. At one time they were thought to be two lookalike species with <em>porphyrosporus</em> growing under deciduous trees and having flesh that stains, versus <em>pseudoscaber</em> that grew under conifers with cap flesh that DNS. At this point they are considered to be one species with a fair amount of variation, but it's an uncommon mushroom to begin with and I don't know how many specimens were sampled. To that extent the name remains up in the air.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Unknown.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>Cap skin turns mahogany-red.

There are some additional differences that show up under a microscope and tend to confirm that <em>harrisonii</em> really is a separate, if lookalike species.\n\n<strong>Edibility:</strong> Good.\n\n<strong>CHEMICAL TESTS:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>NH4OH (Ammonia): </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>KOH: </strong>No data.</li>\n 	<li><strong>FeSO4 (Iron Salts): </strong>No data.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Boletus-campestris-.html "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Expert</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Boletus campestris "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mushroom Observer</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus-campestris-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Boletus campestris "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Image Search</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0394519922"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-619 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lincoff-Audubon.jpg"" alt=""National Audubon Society Field guide to Mushrooms, Gary Lincoff"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0813122627"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-full wp-image-621 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roody-WV-mushrooms.jpg"" alt=""Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><a href=""http://astore.amazon.com/httpwpamushro-20/detail/0815632444"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-full wp-image-620 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/North-American-Boletes.jpg"" alt=""North American Boletes"" /></a></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;""> 0</td>\n<td style=""vertical-align: middle;""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2560 aligncenter"" src=""https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/WP/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boletes-of-Eastern-North-America-1-e1496427834704.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""95"" height=""143"" /></td>\n<td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"">223</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",,,none,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"FILTER SET #1: REGION > ZONE 2- the MIDWEST > 1.
